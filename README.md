# Caesar Scipher Cracker
>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

This is a console application I made in Python for fun.  The program checks a string of text for the most common letter(s) and then asks the user to supply which character they think the most common character represents.  (In english, this is usually e.)  Then the program uses the supplied character as a key to shift he input string and if the key was correct, will display the plaintext version of the string.

## Example Scipher:
>Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
>Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
